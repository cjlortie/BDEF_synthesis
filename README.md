# BDEF_synthesis
EDA on diversity and functional synthesis for tipping points.  

Tipping points in interactions associated with ecosystem function.
Authors: Christopher J. Lortie, Jenna Braun, and Gavin Stewart

Summary  
A formal meta-analysis will be done to explore the relative importance of total number of species examined in a given study that explicitly examined ecological hypotheses for ecological function.  The relative importance of the simplest measure of diversity, i.e. richness will be compiled from all studies, and the hypotheses associated with BDEF will also be classified and tested as a composite and individually. The purpose is both to update existing syntheses and focus more precisely on contemporary theories and process in development.
